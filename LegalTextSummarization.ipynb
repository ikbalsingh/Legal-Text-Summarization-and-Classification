       "' 1 in the supreme court of india criminal appellate jurisdiction criminal appeal no(s). 420 of 2010 Tom ...appellant(s) versus the state of punjab ...respondent(s) order 1. two (02) accused were convicted by the learned trial court for a triple murder that took place in the intervening night of 2nd/ 3rd august, 2002. the deceased were the father, the mother and the brother of accused John who has since withdrawn his appeal. the present appellant Tom was a tenant in the house belonging to the deceased. 2. there is no eye-witness to the crime. the prosecution sought to bring home the guilt of the accused on the basis 2 of circumstantial evidence which have been set out by the high court in the impugned order in seriatim which is extracted below: “1. appellant John had been disinherited by his parents vide public notice ex.-p26. mrs. Sophia had also sworn an affidavit (ex.p25) to that effect. 2. appellant had been proceeded against in the security proceedings at the instance of his mother and, vide order dated 10.04.1986 (ex.-p24), he had been bound down for breach of peace. 3. appellant John had no understandable reason to visit his parents after 8/9 years, particularly when he was the lone visitor and he had stayed over a fortnight. 4. he is proved to have been wearing a white kurta and pajama when he was last seen on the preceding night by Emily (pw)-2. however, he was only in an underwear when he went over to the adjacent house of Emily (pw)-2 at 1.30 am to intimate that some unknown person had attacked their parents. the blood stained clothes aforementioned were, later on, got recovered by appellant, 3 John, in pursuance of a disclosure statement. 5. appellant Tom got the recovery of the weapon of offence effected from the house of an aunt of his. except him, none else could possibly have any inkling about that place of concealment. this circumstances connects appellant Tom with the crime for which he stands convicted. 6. the fact that two co-accused are absconding and did not face the trial is evident from the record. 7. the allegation of motive against Emily (pw)-2, her sister and the husband of the latter is too fragile to be accepted. they had to, in any case, get the property of Adam on account of the disinheritance of John appellant by his parents. as a real sister, Emily would be least interested in losing her only living brother after the murder of her parents and the other brother. having separated from her husband, she is already distraught woman.” 4 3. except for the recovery of a dagger at the instance of the present accused appellant Tom there is no other incriminating material. the motive attributed for the crime is only qua the accused John. all other circumstances are relatable to the said accused John. 4. recovery of dagger which can be reasonably connected with the postmortem report, undoubtedly, is a very strong incriminating circumstance. but it is our considered view that the above, by itself, cannot permit us to arrive at a conclusion, without any error, that it is the accused appellant Tom and nobody else who could have and did commit the crime. a lurking doubt remains in our minds which the accused appellant Tom would be entitled to. we, therefore, allow this 5 appeal and set aside the order of the high court as well as the conviction and sentence recorded against the accused appellant Tom who is acquitted on the benefit of doubt. we further direct that the appellant Tom be released from custody forthwith unless his custody is required in connection with any other case.'"

      "except him, none else could possibly have any inkling about that place of concealment. this circumstances connects appellant ramesh kumar with the crime for which he stands convicted. a lurking doubt remains in our minds which the accused appellant ramesh kumar would be entitled to. but it is our considered view that the above, by itself, cannot permit us to arrive at a conclusion, without any error, that it is the accused appellant ramesh kumar and nobody else who could have and did commit the crime. 5. appellant ramesh kumar got the recovery of the weapon of offence effected from the house of an aunt of his. having separated from her husband, she is already distraught woman.” 4 3. except for the recovery of a dagger at the instance of the present accused appellant ramesh kumar there is no other incriminating material. the present appellant ramesh kumar was a tenant in the house belonging to the deceased. we, therefore, allow this 5 appeal and set aside the order of the high court as well as the conviction and sentence recorded against the accused appellant ramesh kumar who is acquitted on the benefit of doubt. we further direct that the appellant ramesh kumar be released from custody forthwith unless his custody is required in connection with any other case. \n",
